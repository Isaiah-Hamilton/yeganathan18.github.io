## About me

> ***Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.***

I'm Yeganathan S, a sophomore pursuing my bachelor's majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. Currently working as a Full-stack developer, building a next-generation cybersecurity edtech platform at [Traboda CyberLabs](https://traboda.com/about). For me, coding has been always a passion rather than a profession, and am always open to collaborating on projects and innovative/disruptive ideas. As a developer, I have hands-on experience in designing, developing, implementing applications and solutions using a range of technologies and programming languages. People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with excellent adaptability and communication skills.

**Areas of Interest:** Software Development, Product Design, Graphic Design, Problem Solving, and Business Development.
