## About me

> ***A Github contribution a day, keeps imposter syndrome away!***

I am Yeganathan S, a sophomore pursuing bachelor's majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. 

My most recent position was at Traboda CyberLabs, a cybersecurity ed-tech startup where I worked as a Full-stack developer - brainstorming ideas, building APIs, designing next-gen UI with strategic ideas to market them as well, also QA Tester occasionally. 

I am an open-source contributor and primarily contributing [@ooni-probe](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli) and [@supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase). Apart from coding, I do write blogs and read boooks ðŸ“š
